For some reason I got completely lost in git on this challenge. I finally got to the end of it. Phew! I also think that I might not have this fully optimised for mobile (?). 

In the end I sort of cheated when attempting to center div1 in the middle of the page. I wanted to use flexbox to align it vertically but couldn't get it to work so I simply gave it a 20vh margin-top. 

Probably not the best approach but I welcome any feedback on this. Thanks in advance,
